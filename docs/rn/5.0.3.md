# Improvements

- Class-reflected schemas for `map` complex types will generate key/value properties with "key" and "value" names, respectively. This is required in order to deserialise externally generated parquet files with dictionaries.
- Updated dependent packages.
- Class deserializer will check for type compatibility when deserialising incompatible types, which will prevent accidental data loss or narrowing. Thanks to @dkotov in #573.
